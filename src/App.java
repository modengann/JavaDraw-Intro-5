 *  Goals:
 *  1. Copy the contents of your smileyFace method from the previous assignment (JavaDraw Intro 4) and place the 
 *     code into the printSmiley(Location location) method below.
 *  2. Update your code so that the printSmiley method will draw the smiley face at the Location provided
 *     We should be able to then call printSmiley from a pre-defined method like mouseDown()
 *  3. Add the public void mouseDown(Location location, int button){} method.
 *  4. Call printSmiley from the mouseDown method so that the smiley face will appear wherever you click
